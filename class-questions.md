the book states that the scrolling attribute for ```<iframe>``` will not be supported in HTML5? Can we use this? What else can we use?
- three possible values :
    - yes to show scroll bars
    - no to hide scroll bars
    - auto to show only if needed

Same question for frameborder
- indicates whether the frame should have a border or not
    - a 0 value is no border
    - a 1 value is a border

What exactly does the seamless attribute do for the ```<iframe>``` element?
