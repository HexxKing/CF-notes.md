# Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page - like headings, subheadings, paragraphs.
- They also provide semantic information -ie where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation.


# Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look
- Rules are made up selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of elemet that you want to change, and the values of those properties. 
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page

# Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
- A script is made up a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. 
  - ex: you want to specify that a value must be stored before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one pieces of related information
- JS distinguishes between numbers 0 thru 9, strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
- conditional statments allow your code to amke decisions about what to do next. 
- Comparison operators are used to compare two operands
  - ```===```
  - ```!==```
  - ```==```
  - ```!=```
  - ```<``` or ```>```
  - ```<=``` or ```=>```
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
- if...else statments allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
