# Article: [“6 Reasons for Pair Programming”](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
 - pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together
 - Driver
  - is actually typing the code 
 - Navigator
  - is navigating the bigger picture and helping with solutions
- Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
- Abilities fostered:
  - Greater efficiency: pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding
  - engaged collaboration: we rely more on each other and can often find a solution together faster
  - learning from fellow students and working with a teammate can expose devs to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of
  - social skills have long-term career impacts. It’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.
