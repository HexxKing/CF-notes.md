# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## JavaScript and jQuery book by Jon Duckett pages 293-301
1. Find elements using CSS-style selectors
  - Jquery selectors perform a similar task to traditional DOM queries, but the syntax is much simpler
  - You can store the jQuery object in a varible, just as you can with DOM nodes
  - You can use Jquery methods and properties (like DOM methods and properties) to manipulate the DOM nodes that you select.
2. Do something with the elements using Jquery methods
  - The jQuery object has many methods that you can use to work with the elements you select. 
  - The methods represet tasks that you commonly need to perform with elements.
  - jQuery has methods that offer web developers simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as: 
    - loop through elements
    - add/remove elements from the DOM tree
    - handle events
    - fade elements into / out of view
    - handle Ajax requests
    - chaining of methods 
      - Once you have selected some elements, this allows you to apply multiple methods to the same selection.

#### Differences from DOM
- It's cross-browser, and there is no need to write fallback code
  - to do this, jQuery uses feature detection to find the best way to achieve a task. 
  - It involves the use of many conditional statements: if the browser supports the ideal way to achieve a task, it uses that approach, otherwise, it tests to see if it supports the next best option to achieve the same task. 
- Selecting elements is simpler (beause it usese CSS-style syntax) and is more accurate
- Event handling is simpler as it used one method that works in all major browsers
- Methods affect all the selected elements without the need to loop through each one
- Additional methods are provided for popular required tasks such as animation
- Once you habe made a selection, you can apply multiple methods to it

#### Why Use jQuery?
- jQuery doesnt do anything you cannot achieve with pure JS
- It is just a JS file but has been used on over a 1/4 of the sites on the web because it makes coding simpler
- "Write less, Do more" allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JS
