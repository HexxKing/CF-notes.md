# [Consider the history: Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/)
- In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. 
- In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.
- In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women, but those numbers began to drop dramatically in the middle of the decade. 
  - By 2016, that number had been whittled down to 18%. 
  - This dip in the 1980s has created a chasm that the past 30 years hasn’t been able to overcome—and the dude-centric computer marketing campaigns of that time may be to blame.
- the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed specifically to boys (included them teasing girls’ computer skills), as were a whole range of other consoles. 
  - This gave rise to male computing culture. As a result, a 1985 study reported that 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women surveyed.
- This bias toward boys in advertising has a fascinating history in its own right. 
  - In 1983, the US experienced a video game recession. The market shrank from $3.2 billion in 1983 to $100 million in 1985, a drop of 97%. 
  - The crash was primarily brought about by low-quality games flooding the market, which smothered consumer confidence. 
  - Subsequently, marketers trying to rebuild the industry sought to leverage the small audience they had left, which, according to their research, was mostly boys.
- that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects. 
  - By the time students now reach university, 20% of men plan to take on a career in engineering or computing. 
  - Among women, that number is just 5.8%. Women start out so far behind that they often can’t catch up.
- Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and mathematics, the male-dominated environment that has arisen becomes an obstacle to entry for many.
- US women are 45% more likely than men to leave careers in technology. 
  - The research revealed that women often feel isolated due to a lack of female role models and the sense of being excluded from “buddy networks” among men. 
  - Once you add in the fact that only 38% of US women get their ideas endorsed by leadership (compared to 44% of men), you soon end up with the scenario in which almost a third of women say they want to quit within the first year.
- it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close. 
  - Until that happens, as Ames argues, advertising will continue to drive “a subtle message to girls and women that it’s not a place where they belong.

# [Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)
- this is a chart that shows the gender and ethnicity gap in technology between 2014 and 2017.
- All but one company listed here are made up of less than 50% women.
- it appears while some companies care to hire more women, they don't care to employ more diverse ethnicities AND the same can be said the other way around. 
  - The companies that do hire more diverse ethnicites, don't seem to hire a lot of women. 
- Indiegogo, Pandora, Pinterest, Groupon and LinkedIn hire the most women
  - 40% to 50% of their companies are made up of women

# [Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)
- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
  - Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
- Diverse companies perform better
  - In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”
  - in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. 
- We’ve spoken with a few leaders that are hesitant to rely on the reasons above because, as they point out, some of the most successful and innovative companies are not very diverse. 
  - anecdotes of companies that have succeeded in spite of homogeneity are not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.  
- Companies are losing out on great talent 
  - Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
  - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
- It’s the right thing to do 
  - While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, some CEOs are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.
  - Some of these leaders have noted that the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality. 
    - Others have emphasized a concern that by failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community members’ ideas.
