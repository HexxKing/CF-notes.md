## [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
- Randint : accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. The first value should be less than the second.
- Choice : can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.
- Shuffle : shuffles the elements in a list in place, so they are in a random order.
- Randrange : Generate a randomly selected element from range 
  - rangerandom.randrange(start, stop[, step])

## [What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)
- In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

### Why use Risk Analysis?
- In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.
  - Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting
  - Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas
  - Create a Risk Assessment database for future use
  - Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.
    - High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.
    - Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.
    - Low: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

### Risk Identification
- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required
- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

### Perspective of Risk Assessment
- Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
- Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
- Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

### How to perform Risk Analysis?
- Searching the risk
- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
- Measures for the risk identified
