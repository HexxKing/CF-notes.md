- `[ expression for item in list if conditional ]`

- `*result* = [*transform* *iteration* *filter* ]`


- List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
- It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more **for** or **if** clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.
- The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the **for** and **if** clauses which follow it.
- The list comprehension always returns a result list.

> OLD WAY: 
>
> `for item in list:`
`      if conditional: `
`           expression `
>
> You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension.
