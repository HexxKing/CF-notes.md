### Machine learning is not about algorithms
- Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems and individual algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The rest of the puzzle is how you apply them the right way.
- For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.
- Terminology : 
  - Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
  - Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
  - Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
  - Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
  - Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
  - Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
  - Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.
