  - This was an interesting story to watch as it unfolded over the years. There very much was a violation of Microsoft's ethical morals by continuing to supply software to Trump's ICE agency who absolutely abused human rights. Microsoft attracts employees because of their great morals and values and a lot of employees saw where the software they were building was falling short of those morals and values. It is impressive that enough employees took a public stand against the sale of their software to ICE that the CEOs of major tech companies came together to try to help where they could. In 2019, Microsoft bought Github and that introduced another issue where Github also had a contracts with ICE. Unfortunatly, Microsoft/Github waited for the contracts to expire in 2020 before decided they would not renew them. But by that time, the damage had already been done and families had already been ripped apart. In 2021, Microsoft has retracked all funding to the Rebulican party and removed Trump from any platform he may participate in. But this is a very hard pill for me to swallow since one of the reasons I want to work for Microsoft so badly is their stance on diversity and inclusion. Microsoft's $8 billion dollar contracts with ICE directly contradicts their statement to uplift everyone, in all parts of the world and that is a real shame.

  - This was a perfect article to read given the current political state of our country. Search engines are reflecting our own bias back to us which is causing a deeper divide in the way we think. Is it time to implement a "good" conscience on the internet and who gets to decide what is "good"? How is that person monitored? Who decides who that person gets to be? What happens if that person makes a "bad" decision and teaches the rest of the world that bad decision? All these questions are difficult to answer because it's impossible to know what the "right" thing to do because everyone has different needs. So the question becomes an ethical question of how to serve the needs of either most of the population or everyone. How do you decide what's best for everyone? That's the big question.
