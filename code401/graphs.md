- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed. Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
- A "complete graph" is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- A "connected graph" is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
  - A `Tree` is a form of a connected graph.
- A "disconnected graph" is a graph where some vertices may not have edges. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.
- A "cycle" is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- An "acyclic graph" is a directed graph without cycles.
  - A directed acyclic graph is also called a "DAG". This can also be represented as what we know as a **tree**.
- A "Cyclic graph" is a graph that has cycles.
- An "Adjacency matrix" is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are *n* vertices, then we are looking at an *n x n* Boolean matrix
  - Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.
  - a "sparse graph" is when there are very few connections. 
  - a "dense graph" is when there are many connections
  - Within an adjacency matrix, an undirected graph will always be symmetric. This is not the case for a directed graph.
- An "adjacency list" is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.
- A "weighted graph" is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called "weights". 
  - When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths. If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a `0`, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead.
  - Within adjacency lists, you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex.
- Breadth first traversal is when you visit all the nodes that are closest to the root as possible. In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the `BreadthFirst()` method. The breadth-first traversal of a graph is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs can have cycles. When a graph has cycles and we are trying to traverse, this leaves the possibility to be in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some sort of flag that specifies if we have already visited that vertices. Upon each visit, we just set the “visited” flag from `False` to `True`.
  - If there are any disconnected nodes (such as islands) with the graph data structure, they will not be traversed.
  - Breadth-first only outputs the nodes that are connected in some relation to the root that you pass in.
- In a depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree.
  - `Push` the root node into the stack
  - Start a while loop while the stack is not empty
  - `Peek` at the top node in the stack
  - If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, and then `Push` any unvisited children back into the stack.
  - If the top node does not have any unvisited children, `Pop` that node off the stack
  - repeat until the stack is empty.
