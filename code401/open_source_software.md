# [What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)
- Improve Coding Skills
  - For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers.
- Gain Early Experience
  - Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.
- Increase Community and Peer Recognition
  - Recognition from members from the OSS community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve his or her skills, it can also create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events, etc.
- Greater Job Prospects
  - The fact that OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written. In contrast, commercial (proprietary) software doesn’t provide you with the same proof of your abilities, and overall it is much harder to gain experience in this realm.
- Improve Software on a User and Business Level
  - Within every open-source project, the requirements for non-programming skills and contributions are just as necessary.
